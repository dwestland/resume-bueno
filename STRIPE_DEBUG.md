# Stripe Integration Debugging

## Issues Found & Fixed

1. **Webhook Handling Inconsistency**

   - The webhook handler had separate logic for monthly and yearly subscriptions
   - Yearly subscriptions were directly updating user records, while monthly were using `recordSubscriptionPurchase`
   - **Fix**: Updated webhook handler to use `recordSubscriptionPurchase` for both subscription types

2. **Test Script Protocol Mismatch**

   - Test scripts were attempting to use HTTPS for an HTTP endpoint
   - **Fix**: Updated scripts to use HTTP instead of HTTPS

3. **Webhook Signature Verification**

   - Webhook signature verification was failing in test scenarios
   - **Fix**: Added better error handling and logging to diagnose the issue
   - **Fix**: Created a direct test endpoint to bypass webhook signature verification

4. **Added Debugging Tools**
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the webhook handling process
   - Created test scripts for each purchase type (monthly, yearly, credits)
   - Added a test endpoint (`/api/test-stripe?userId=...`) to directly trigger subscription recording

## Verification Steps

1. **Direct Testing**

   - We verified that `recordSubscriptionPurchase` works correctly when called directly
   - This confirms the core functionality is working without relying on webhook processing

2. **Test Script Updates**
   - Updated the test scripts to properly load environment variables and log more details
   - Fixed the signature generation to match Stripe's expected format

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Test Webhook Handler with Real Stripe Events**

   - Use the Stripe CLI to forward real webhook events to your local server

   ```
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3200/api/webhook/stripe
   ```

2. **Check User Record Updates**

   - After successful webhook processing, verify that the user record has:
     - Updated `subscription_plan` to MONTHLY or YEARLY
     - Updated `subscription_status` to ACTIVE
     - Updated `credits` to 200
     - Updated `subscription_start` and `subscription_end` dates

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add additional logging to the `recordSubscriptionPurchase` function
   - Monitor webhook events and user record updates in production

## Security Note

- The test endpoint (`/api/test-stripe`) should be removed in production
- It is protected with an environment check but should not be deployed
